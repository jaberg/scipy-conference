Dear SciPy 2014 presenter,

Congratulations on having your talk accepted for this year's event--we look
forward to hearing your presentation!  As in the past, SciPy2014 will
release a conference proceedings, and you are invited to contribute a
full-length paper (up to 8 pages) expanding on your abstract.

The proceedings are aimed at highlighting significant contributions to
scientific computing in Python, such as:

* new software packages that support the Scientific Python Stack
* significant improvements to existing software packages
* Descriptions of how to solve hard computational problems with Python
* Hardware systems designed to support the Python stack
* <blah blah blah, borrow from the CFP for talks and posters>

Pull requests are to be submitted by **May 18th**, but modifications are
allowed during the open review period which ends **July 5th**.  During this
time, members from the program committee will provide feedback which can be
addressed by updating the pull request.
